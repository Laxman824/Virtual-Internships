## Project Title
Crack the hashcode of leaked passwords online | GoldmanSachs

 ## Overview: Crack leaked password database

Your job is to crack as many passwords as possible with available tools (e.g. use Hashcat). Here are your Task instructions:

```bash
1. Review the links provided in the additional resources (section 4) below to gain a background understanding of password cracking

2. Try to crack the passwords provided in the 'password dump' file below using available tools

3. Assess the 5 questions in the task instructions below in relation to the passwords provided (type of hashing algorithm, level of protection, possible controls that could be implemented, password policy, changes in policy)

4. Draft an email/memo briefly explaining your findings in relation to controls used by the organization and your proposed uplifts. We recommend spending about 1.5 hours on this task and keeping it at 1 page in length

```

## Installation
```bash
sudo apt-get install hashcat
sudo apt install plocate
locate wordlist
git clone https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o cracked.txt hashs.txt /home/laxman/Desktop/Virtual Interns/Goldman Sachs/rockyou.txt
if already passwords are cracked 
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o cracked.txt codes.txt /home/laxman/Desktop/VirtualInterns/GoldmanSachs/rockyou.txt --potfile-disable
```

**Goldman Sachs Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program on Forage - March
2024**

 * Completed a job simulation as a Goldman Sachs governance analyst responsible
   for assessing IT security and suggesting improvements.
 * Identified that the company was using an outdated password hashing algorithm
   by cracking passwords using Hashcat.
 * Wrote a memo for my supervisor summarizing a range of proposed uplifts to
   increase the companyâ€™s level of password protection including extending
   minimum password length and using a dedicated hashing algorithm.
