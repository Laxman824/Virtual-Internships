**Goldman Sachs Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program on Forage - March
2024**

 * Completed a job simulation as a Goldman Sachs governance analyst responsible
   for assessing IT security and suggesting improvements.
 * Identified that the company was using an outdated password hashing algorithm
   by cracking passwords using Hashcat.
 * Wrote a memo for my supervisor summarizing a range of proposed uplifts to
   increase the companyâ€™s level of password protection including extending
   minimum password length and using a dedicated hashing algorithm.
