Goldman Sachs Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program on Forage - March
2024

 * Completed a job simulation as a Goldman Sachs governance analyst responsible
   for assessing IT security and suggesting improvements.
 * Identified that the company was using an outdated password hashing algorithm
   by cracking passwords using Hashcat.
 * Wrote a memo for my supervisor summarizing a range of proposed uplifts to
   increase the company’s level of password protection including extending
   minimum password length and using a dedicated hashing algorithm.
   
   “Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in Goldman Sachs’ job simulation on Forage and it was
incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to work as a governance
analyst there. This simulation enabled me to build my experience cracking
passwords using a range of tools including Hashcat.
Once I had cracked passwords I was able to come up with a range of uplifts to
suggest that would increase the overall level of password protection across the
organization.
Through this experience, I’ve validated that I really enjoy working on highly
impactful technical projects in great detail. I can see just how this project
would have a significant impact on Goldman Sachs as a company and on its
customers by increasing the level of security to reduce the risk of a successful
hack.
In future, I would love to apply what I’ve learned during this job simulation in
a governance team at Goldman Sachs.
